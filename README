What
----

A collection of JSON datasets for various CouchDB dev purposes

Why
---
I've long felt the need for a set of standard databases that everyone could use for various development purposes such as

a) creating example views, CouchApps ...
b) doing performance tests that could be used to do apples/apples comparisons
c) create training materials

Sybase has a standard "pubs" database that is shipped with the db distro. All tutorials, and most 3rd party training books use this database to teach database basics, database design, performance tuning etc.  The Java world has the PetStore app which became a template "hello world" J2EE app.

My hope is that this collection of datasets and tools will fulfill a similar "well known dataset" function in the CouchDB world and the larger NoSQL world.

How
---

I've taken the <a href="http://openlibrary.org> Open Library </a> data sets doen some minor cleanup and sliced them into samples of 1K and 100K JSON objects.
Each file is a concatenation of JSON objects but not a proper serialised JSON object as a whole.   So you'll need to do some minor parsing to pull the individual JSON objects into
CouchDB.


Now what
--------

I am going to use these data sets when creating sample CouchApps of any kind and also for creating Sproingg test messages (see http://nborwankar.github.com/sproingg).
More data sets from OpenLibrary and other sources will turn up here.
If you have data sets to contribute please contact me at nitin at couch dot io.
